# Code Folder 

In this folder all of our code is stored. The main code is the file "SmokingChanges.py", which runs our system and outputs the plots that we use in our report (which are also shown in the media folder). To run that file, one also needs to have the other files from this folder as well (and one needs to store them in the same folder as "SmokingChanges.py").
