# Code Folder 

In this folder all of our code is stored. The main code is the file "SmokingChanges.py", which runs our system and outputs the plots that are also in this folder. To run that file, one also needs to have the file "edgesdata2.mat" which is a Matlab file that helps us to build our society in the main code.
