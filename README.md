Hallo, dies ist ein Test!


## General Introduction

In the Framingham Heart Study more than 12,000 people's health statuses where collected for about three decades (1970s to 2000s). One highly interesting result of this study was the smoking behavior of this network of people and how these people impact each other's smoking habits. For example it showed how one's friends', family's and colleagues' smoking habits have impact on an individual.
In our project we want to use the resulting data to see how smoking beahvior spreads in a random society and how habits develop over time.


## The Model

(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) (Why is your model a good abstraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)


## Fundamental Questions

How do the dynamics in a society develope over time in our model regarding smoking?
What are fix points of our model, i.e. will there be groups of smokers or will the whole society be (non-)smoking?
Do our results reflect the reality, for example the smokers data from Switzerland or the results of the Framingham Heart Study?


## Expected Results

(What are the answers to the above questions that you expect to find before starting your research?)


## References 

(Add the bibliographic references you intend to use)
(Explain possible extension to the above models)
(Code / Projects Reports of the previous year)


## Research Methods

(Cellular Automata, Agent-Based Model, Continuous Modeling...) (If you are not sure here: 1. Consult your colleagues, 2. ask the teachers, 3. remember that you can change it afterwards)


## Other

(mention datasets you are going to use)

# Reproducibility

(step by step instructions to reproduce your results. *Keep in mind that people reading this should accomplish to reproduce your work within 10 minutes. It needs to be self-contained and easy to use*. e.g. git clone URL_PROY; cd URL_PROY; python3 main.py --light_test (#--light test runs in less than 5minutes with up to date hardware))
